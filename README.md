## General Information
- using the given data, analyzing the pattern of bikes usage by the customer 
- fitting a regression line on the variable cnt, which tells the no of customers who rented the bikes 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- from the regression line fitted, it can be interpreted that the counts can be interpreted using the data of the customers who chose the service were if registered or casual and depending upon the months of Oct and Dec along with humidity 
- the ine fit has a R2 and adj-R2 of 1
